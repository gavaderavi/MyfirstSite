<p class="ex2">In the year 2008, I got married to a twenty year old orphan girl, Sujata, whose parents had died of AIDS. 
We lived in Satara, a small town in Maharashtra. The villagers knew nothing about the deadly disease except 
that it was contagious and since Sujata’s parents were afflicted with AIDS, they assumed she and I were most 
likely to contract it and spread it around town. We were thrown out of the village and I soon began work at 
various NGO at Pune, and we decided to open 
<span style="color:#089f8a; font-weight:bold;">SPARSH (Shelter & Rehabilitation Center for HIV/AIDS infected children’s)</span>
<br><br><br>

Until today, we have 250 children have been rehabilitated in the society.Today, the organization boasts of seventeen 
children between the age group of 6 to 16 years and looks after their mental, physical and emotional needs. 
Lack of funds and Government support does tie our hands to a great extent but a noble mission such as this can 
hardly be put aside for the sake of convenience or comfort. The children are housed in a 2bhk apartment which 
they share with us. It‘s a tight squeeze and every other day is a struggle to make ends meet but the joy of 
seeing them smile makes it all worthwhile.</p><br /><br>
